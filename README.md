## Description 
This project lets you run a simple Java program. Once ran you are entered into an animal sanctuary in which you are able to view current animals as well as empty lots, feed them from a random range of 0-10 units of food, and add animals from a predetermined list of blob fishes, naked mole rats, and sugar gliders. Once complete you are able to quit.

## Lessons Learned

This project took me far longer than i thought it would. I learned that even simple scrips can take an abundance of time if the concepts are out of your grasp but not out of your time and patience. For loops with arrays are something i struggle in at the moment and thats what mainly ate up all of my time. Creating classes and extending them was a simple portion of this project but learning how each of the methods, getters and setters and how to output what you want them to do is far more complicated in concept than in action. I had to rewrite my program more than a couple of times to try and get it to work as I wanted it to due to over-usage in all of the concepts in class and the solution was by just using the most simple concepts that we have learned within the past two weeks. What I have mainly learned today was that overcomplicating and overthinking simple solutions is not what a programmer should strive to do.
